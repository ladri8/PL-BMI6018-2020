    "4. \\__add\\__(self,other): to add the mylists of the two objects element-wise and to return the object of the resultant list.<br> For example [12,3,4]+[2,3,4]= [14,6,8] (5 points)\n",
    "5. \\__mul\\__(self,other): to multiply the mylists of the two objects element-wise and to return the object of the resultant list.<br> For example [12,3,4]*[2,3,4]= [24,9,16] (5 points)\n",
    "6. \\__lt\\__(self, other): it returns true if each element from the first myList is less than the corresponding element from the second myList in element-wise; otherwise, it return false.<br> For example, The method returns false if  the input is the two lists of [12,3,4] and [2,3,4]  (5 points)\n",
