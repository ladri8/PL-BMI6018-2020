    "1. Procedural proggramming: The program is lists of instructions that tell the computer what to do with the program’s input.         \n",
    "2. Functional programming: Programming decomposes a problem into a set of functions. Ideally, functions only take inputs and produce outputs, and don’t have any internal state that affects the output produced for a given input. A function maybe a nested or parent of others. A function can be a paramter and passed to another.       \n",

    "<b> Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a method of structuring a program by bundling related properties and behaviors (methods) into individual objects. </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> For instance, an object could represent a person with properties like a name, age, and address and behaviors (methods) such as walking, talking, breathing, and running. </b>\n",

    "<b>Another common programming paradigm is procedural programming, which structures a program like a recipe in that it provides a set of steps, in the form of functions and code blocks, that flow sequentially in order to complete a task. </b> \n",

    "2. Instance − An individual object of a certain class. An object obj that belongs to a class Circle, for example, is an instance of the class Circle. \n",
    "3. Instance variable − A variable that is defined inside a method and belongs only to the current instance of a class.      \n",
